<GITHUB></GITHUB>

**A small but nasty C# program for "Ctrl + C" - "Ctrl + V" lovers**

Let's go
=====================

The best way to run the executable file (.exe program) is to deploy a virtual machine - **VMWare** or **VirtualBox**.

How to delete?
=====================

- "Win + R", in the window that opens type "regedit".
- Go to the registry and then follow the following path and delete the key name KEMON:
```
HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\MICROSOFT\WINDOWS\CurrentVersion\Run
```
- We go to the task manager and terminate the program in the processes.
